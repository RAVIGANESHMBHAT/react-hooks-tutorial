# React Hooks

#### Hooks are a new feature addition in React version 16.8 which allow us to use React features without having to write a class.

#### Note: Hooks don't work inside classes.

## Why Hooks?
* Hooks avoid confusion with 'this' keyword
* Allows to reuse stateful logic without changing component hierarchy
* Organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units.

### Rules to use hooks
* Only call Hooks at the top level
* Don't call hooks inside conditions, loops or nested functions
* Only call hooks from React function (Not with regular JavaScript functions)
